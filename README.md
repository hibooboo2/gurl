# GURL is a command line tool for using REST APIs.

Meant to be an opinionated clone of CURL written in golang. Just a small pet project.
Mostly to make hitting rest apis easier from the terminal and viewing the json.
Very early stage and will develop as needed for my purposes unless others decide to use.

Open to prs.
